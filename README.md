### NB-2: You have to have Sinatra, SQLite3, ActiveRecord and Rails installed on your machine.

## Objectives

1. Make a CRUD app for handling two associated tables (e.g. Authors and Books, Wines and Cheeses etc.)

2. Create two separate tables for those related Objects, seed initial data for testing.

4. View it live via Sinatra reloader on a localhost.

5. Add functionality: add, edit, view, delete.
